## Project Dependencies Setup

This project requires several dependencies to be installed before it can be run successfully. The setup.sh shell script has been provided to automate the installation process.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Poetry
### Installation
To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the **setup.sh** shell script by executing the following command: **./setup.sh.**


This will install all the project dependencies, including the virtual environment using Poetry, pre-commit hooks, and Ruff.
